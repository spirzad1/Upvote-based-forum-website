# Upvote-based-forum-website
A website/forum where game developers can directly communicate with their player base using reddit's upvote system to show the most important issues/topics that need to be addressed. Offers an solution to the growing disconnect between gaming companies and their player bases. 

Going to explore Yik-Yak's code because they have a well-made upvote system thats simple and organized.

- Thinking about replacing "Location" info with the "Issue/Bug". Each user can assign what issue is most important to them that is affecting their gameplay and other users can see that as well as devs. 

Location Setup
It allows you to enter the name of a college or university.

Enter college name or address: Capital University

The app will save this location as default, so you don't have to enter it each time.

Location is set to: Capital University

You can change this location at any time and see yaks from different colleges.

*Choose New Location	(L) or (L <location>)
  
 - Their Actions are very similiar to what I had in mind with their upvote/commenting system. Can use this code to create a medium for users to comment.
